                tl;dr If you’re starting CSS today, don’t use BootStrap, use flexbox, learn to use media-query and
                seriously do mobile-first!
            </p>

                I don’t know CSS When I started web development three years back, I didn’t know anything about it. I had
                never even made a webpage, somehow passed my college (manage D grade in web development), didn’t even
                know what
                tag was.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I remember a friend of mine (Vikram) working as Full Stack Dev was showing me his web app and I was
                blown away, when I asked him how can he make such amazing apps, his words were, “Dude! It’s really easy,
                here, see the bootstrap website!“. Bootstrap made making websites very easy for me. I even took 3-4
                sessions for college grads to introduce them to web development through bootstrap and even they enjoyed
                it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Then why did I move from Bootstrap</strong> So here, I am happy with Bootstrap making web apps
                and outsourcing all
                my styling needs to Bootstrap, taking care of responsiveness and everything. Then, in my current
                workplace, I got a task where in we have to inject some rendered code into client’s website. I happily
                designed the component with Bootstrap and it worked all right while testing but it broke in production.
                You ask why? because Bootstrap as a framework was setting things on global level and was either
                overwriting client’s CSS or was being overwritten.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Flex is super easy</strong> You cannot make grids easier than this. Plus it comes with things one
                always struggles
                with: vertical centring!Another good part about flexbox is that it is supported across all major
                browsers. However, you would like to use autoprefixer just in case. I have tested the app on Chrome,
                Firefox, Safari and on mobile Safari.</p>
            <br>
            <h2><strong>SOME ADVICE</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Do Mobile First:</strong> No, really! First thing we should do is we should finalize how things
                will look on
                mobile devices. Then move up the ladder. Understand media queries and min and max width, it’s very easy
                to control the look on different screen sizes. The terms are confusing but it’s super useful. Transform
                Translate is good tool for positioning. Earlier, I used either margin or absolute positioning but it
                would hurt the responsiveness of the site. Wish I would have known about it before. My Mistakes

                While it was very easy to get flexbox working on the JSBin, it almost broke my back integrating it into
                the existing code. As mentioned earlier, I have a bad habit of giving margin. It came back to bite me
                coz wrapping was not working properly.<strong>Lesson learnt:</strong> when doing CSS do a top down
                approach. I need to
                be systematic while designing. I had also used wordwraps and things taken from stackoverflow answers,
                which was breaking a lot of responsiveness. I think I need to get into it and understand how things
                which I use actually work to save time in future.</p>
