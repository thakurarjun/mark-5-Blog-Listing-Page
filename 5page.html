                <strong>A small story,</strong> I live in Bangalore, India and two years back I did a trek to Skandagiri
                (and I am not an
                avid trekker, I guess that was my one and only trek). It’s a small peak with 5 km steep trek and one has
                to do it overnight so that one can witness the sunrise from the peak. It was exciting for like first
                15-20 minutes and then you start hating it, you start questioning why you signed up yourself for this
                trek even when your friends ditched you last minute. Once you’re in the middle of it you make your peace
                with the trek and just go on. Step by step you push yourself towards the peak of the hill hoping that
                the trek will end soon. Mind you, the trek is not fun especially when you’re doing it alone away from
                the group.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Let’s come back to how it feels when you move from Angular to React. <strong>First,</strong> you try it
                because let’s
                face it everyone is using it and praising it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong> Second,</strong> you get frustrated because the learning curve is steep. You have to get into
                Webpack, ES6,
                fetch, redux and everything all at once while learning React. Plus the frustration of making choices:
                Redux or Flux, thunk or promise, fetch or axios, there’s no right way and trust me none of the starter
                kit works! ( React-App is way too basic for anything good )
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Third,</strong> you run your program you get even more frustrated now. No two way binding, then
                there’s JSX so you
                have className vs class errors as you’re used to writing HTML from as far as you remember. Still you
                keep writing hoping that one day it will make sense.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Fourth,</strong> After writing, let’s say two to three medium sized apps you have made your peace
                with the
                ecosystem, with the boilerplate code, with the ‘React’ way of doing things, with one way data flow etc.
                etc. Given any feature now, you can implement it in React with ease but you still don’t understand why
                all the trouble?</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Lastly,</strong> since your code is growing, one day your program does something unexpected! And
                it takes you 5
                minutes only to identify what went wrong and fix it. Then and there it hits you! You now understand why
                all the trouble and that’s when you fall in love with React!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You’re happy now because you know that the actual React/Redux API is minimal. Things are mostly pure
                JavaScript. You are happy that you have learned some functional way of doing web development. And let’s
                be honest for a second, ES6 and Webpack both were worthy of the investment you put in coz the power you
                get in the language (ES6) and the build system with bundling, cache busting, gzip, hot reload and what
                not (Webpack) has spoiled you for good!
