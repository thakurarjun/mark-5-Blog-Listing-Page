                Aren’t there times in life where we wish we could just go back in time and tell yourself to do something
                better. To start a project with a better approach, to share your learnings with your younger self. The
                classic I-need-a-time-machine to-fix this code! It would just save so much time refactoring your code.
                Like many of you who are reading this code, I learned React/Redux from online videos and tutorials. Many
                of these tutorials are outdated, and or made too easy for the students to understand React. These were
                never intended to be production level code.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I have been working on React almost exclusively from past one year and have been reading and writing
                code. Below tips are from my personal experiences of refactoring code not once but many times.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>1. Use ES7 features,</strong>if you’re not using ES6 then you can probably not write React these
                days, but even better would be to use ES7.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>2. Start with the latest stable versions:</strong>React 16, React Router 4, Webpack 3 at least.
                Better if you use the stable latest versions from start. This will save your time in upgradation later.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3. Use Proptypes:</strong> This serves dual purpose, documentation and sort of type checking for
                your components. You can also provide default values to your props so that if things go south from the
                API response your app will not just crash and burn.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>4. Setup separate dev, stage and prod environments.</strong>You can assign the env variable in
                React using the DefinePlugin. Use NPM scripts to run different versions as per requirements. It’s super
                easy.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>5. Comment your logic along,</strong>document the components. You think and make yourself
                believe that you’ll remember but trust me you won’t.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>6. Use async/await,</strong>if not at least promises!: If you’re starting now, it’s best to use
                async/await than the promise. Makes the code easy on eyes and also easier to understand. If you see the
                newer documentations for any Javascript library/framework you’ll see async/await being used extensively.
                Use async/await for your node server as well. Node supports async/await from 7.6.0 and above. Node 8 is
                stable and LTS release.
                <br>
                If for some reason, you can’t use async/await at least use promises.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>7. Don’t forget Testing:</strong>Jest is easy to setup. Requires minimal developer time but
                saves major bugs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>8. Setup your Webpack for versioning and chunking,</strong>8. Setup your Webpack for versioning and chunking, don’t start with Webpack 1 anymore. Higher versions
                support a lot of useful features by default for example tree shaking to make your build leaner.</p>
