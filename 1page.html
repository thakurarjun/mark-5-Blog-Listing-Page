      <h2>skip if you don’t like intros</h2>
      <p>
        Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in
        React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL.
        The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel
        of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the
        community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I
        did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review
        some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this
        course to a lot many people I know.

        While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is
        little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for
        beginners.
        <br />
        <strong>pace</strong> is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that
        you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing.
        <br />
        <strong>full screencast</strong> of code, I like where I don’t have to
        see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things on
        codepad. So, this was a huge +
        <br />
        <strong>great example</strong> for the entire tutorial as it covers
        why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the
        concepts of GQL.

      <h2>what you need to know to do this course?</h2>
      <p>
        To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>ExpressJS</li>
        <li>ReactJS</li>
        <li>CSS & HTML</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you don’t know any of these, there are tutorials on NetNinja itself
        to help you with it. If you know all of it, (like I did), nothing can
        be better than this.

      <h2>what you get to learn from this course?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a full stack graphQL course. It covers everything you would
        need to make a graphQL app.
        <br />
      <h3><strong>FOR THE BACKEND</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mutations</li>
        <li>Queries</li>
        <li>Resolvers</li>
        <li>GraphiQL</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3><strong>ON THE FRONTEND</strong>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          query/mutation fire
        </li>
        <li>
          parameterized query
        </li>
        <li>
          composing multiple query
        </li>
        <li>
          refetching queries on mutation</li>

      <h2>after the course</h2>
      <p>
        As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After you have done the basics you can learn
        about:
      <ul>
        <li>
          graphql subscriptions
        </li>
        <li>
          @client i.e. managing local state
        </li>
        <li>
          typescript support
        </li>
        <li>
          authentication/authorization in the app</li>
        <li>
          writing tests for graphql query/mutations
        </li>
        <li>
          paginated queries</li>
        <li>
          most important: using apolloclient as renderProps which is the current API being used in apollo’s
          documentation and everywhere in code.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>where can I see the final product?
      </h2>
      <p>
        However, the course doesn’t cover how to host it online. I have hosted the entire frontend and backend server
        for free. If you like to know how to host a React+GraphQL app, subscribe to the newsletter below and whenever I
        write it, you’ll get it straight into your inbox.
