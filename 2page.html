        <p>
          The easiest way I could have written this blog was to put some code
          and explain what each line does. I personally feel though, that
          understanding the mechanics behind these things is very important.
          Only then one will be able to fine tune it for individual needs. So
          the clickbait title got you here, now keep reading and ask questions
          in comments if you have any.

        <h3>Why Chunking?</h3>
        <p>
          With the advent of JS frameworks and Single Page Apps(SPAs), more and
          more code, logic and libraries have moved towards user instead of
          being rendered on the server. This, on one side has improved user
          experience but on the other side has increased the total KBs/MBs
          getting downloaded in the browser and thus slowing the first paint.
          Webpack (or whichever build tool you use) bundles all the JS/CSS files
          needed by your app to run in one big file. This was done with the
          belief that small files waste precious HTTP requests (as the browser
          can only do so many at parallel) and thus has its heart at the right
          place. However, as explained, with time the bundle just gets bigger
          and bigger.
          <br />
          Solution is simple, when the build file is too big, it outweighs the
          performance gain of saving an additional HTTP request. At that time
          one needs to start breaking that file into pieces or CHUNKS, hence,
          the name chunking.

        <h2>Why Versioning?</h2>
        <p>
          When a build is broken into chunks, change in one chunk doesn’t affect
          other. For example, change in login page will change the user-control
          chunk but not the app, or the libraries. However, without versioning
          user will have no idea where the changes are and thus, the browser
          will download everything on every download. We don’t want that. We
          want parts/chunks which are not changed to be taken from browser’s
          cache and only the changed parts to be downloaded.
          <br />
          Simple solution is to do a hash of your chunk, i.e. the VERSION and
          append it on the file name. I will show you how to do that in a
          minute, and it’s very easy with the webpack plugins, but even if you
          want to do it without these tools, the idea is simple. Take a hash of
          the file > Append it to file name > Make sure that every time there’s
          a file change this process is repeated.

        <h3>Why Caching?</h3>
        <p>
          Caching is the most important tool in the performance toolbox. The
          less data browser downloads the faster the page loads. Browsers are
          very smart, if it sees that file name hasn’t changed and the cache
          setting for the file permits then it will use the cache copy.
          <br />
          That’s where versioning and caching goes hand in hand. We don’t want
          our users to download an unchanged file every time he visits the
          website (thus, caching) and we don’t want the user to miss out a
          change we pushed because of a stale cache (thus, versioning)

        <h3>How Chunking?</h3>
        <p>
          Ha! now when we have cleared the theory, let’s see how we do it. For
          understanding purposes, I am doing only two chunks, i.e. main and
          vendor. Vendor code is your React, React Router, Redux, Lodash/Ramda
          and other libraries, which is more or less constant and is also the
          biggest in terms of size. With these steps we will make sure that
          user’s subsequent page render speed is improved. Coz after the first
          visit to our web app the user will not have to download this big file
          of vendor code even if the app logic has changed.

        <h3>How Versioning?</h3>
        <p>
          Versioning is very easy to set up with Webpack and is supported in all
          its versions. Irrespective of whether we configure chunking, we can
          setup versioning and even if we don’t configure caching, the default
          settings of browser will make your app faster.

        <h3>How Caching?</h3>
        <p>
          Configuring Caching in itself could be a topic of a blog series. To
          keep it precise, I will share what I have done. We need to set up
          caching on the server side. I use Express ( a micro web framework
          built on top of NodeJS) to serve my build. The setting can be done on
          any such framework. Idea is to set cache to expire on 30 days (just a
          long time, you can set it for a year and it wouldn’t matter). As
          discussed above, since we have versioning set up, new changes will
          have new file names and hence new requests. For old files, this
          setting will ensure that browsers use the file from cache. Now, the
          default cache setting with versioning would have still made a request
          to the server to check if the file has changed, a would have returned
          a 304 NOT MODIFIED it is not changed. The max age property will even
          save that one roundtrip request each file!

          This entire thing is setup (though not in webpack 3) and tested in my
          starter kit on Github. Here’s the link. Performance is like an ongoing
          mission, so one has to keep thriving for better performance. There are
          many more things I have done to increase my apps’ performance. If you
          liked this article, show some appreciation, it will motivate me to
          share some more experiences.
